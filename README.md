### Introduction

This repository contains a demo project built with [SpatialOS](http://www.spatialos.com).

The project serves as a starting point for the [hands-on SpatialOS product demo](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/get-started/tour).

The main documentation for SpatialOS can be found [here](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/reference/13.0/index).
